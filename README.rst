From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalpel:

    A scalpel, or lancet, is a small and extremely sharp bladed instrument used
    for surgery, anatomical dissection, and various arts and crafts (called a
    hobby knife).

Lancet is a command line utility to streamline the various activities related
to the development and maintenance of a software package.

* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: http://lancet.rtfd.org (TODO).


Installation
------------

You can install ``lancet`` from PyPI_. The suggested way to get it on your system
is by using pipsi_::

   brew install libgit2
   pipsi install --python=$(which python3) lancet

.. _PyPI: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lancet
.. _pipsi: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi


Getting started
---------------

Once installed, set up the initial configuration by running::

   lancet setup

TODO: For each not-yet-configured project, you can then run::

   cd path/to/project
   lancet init

This creates a new project-level configuration file that can be shared across
different users (and thus commited to source control).

Features
--------

* Start tasks (create branch, set correct issue status/assignee, start
  linked harvest timer)
* Suspend tasks (pause harvest timer, set issue status)
* Resume tasks (resume timer, set issue status)
* Rapidly open issue tracker task page

See http://cl.ly/0u28140B1Y15 for a short visual demo and ``lancet --help``
for additional details::

   Usage: lancet [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

   Commands:

    logout  Forget saved passwords for the web services.

TODO
----

A lot of commands are still missing, as for example:

* ``init``: to setup the project-level configuration for any given project.
* ``pr``: to open a new pull-request and update the tracker accordingly.
* ``review``: to streamline the whole reviewing process (pulling, linting,\
  diffs,...).
* ``merge``: to help in getting a more strict merge process in place (and
  cleanup afterwards). Can include rebasing helpers.
* Other issue tracker/Harvest interaction utilities (``list``, ``search``,
  ``comment``, ...)
